# SolanaTracker Trade Bot ‚Äî Scooby Fork

A fully overhauled and modular Solana memcoin trading bot built from the foundation of the excellent [YZYLAB/solana-trading-bot](https://github.com/YZYLAB/solana-trading-bot). This version retains almost none of the original code structure but credits the inspiration, naming, and API usage from the original project.

Also, The team at SolanaTracker.io (https://www.solanatracker.io/solana-rpc?via=scoobycarolan) are absolute legends.  Their entire platform is amazing if you want to build on Solana.

## üìå Overview

This bot automates the discovery, evaluation, purchase, monitoring, and sale of high-potential memecoins on the Solana blockchain, using the [Solana Tracker API](https://docs.solanatracker.io). It leverages live chart data, technical indicators, and configurable trade logic to manage positions and maximize profitability.

## üîÑ Coin Lifecycle

Each coin tracked by the bot moves through this lifecycle:

| Status      | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `hold`      | Coin has been added but is not yet eligible for trading |
| `target`    | Bot is actively tracking price & indicators for a decision |
| `open`      | A buy was executed and a position is active |
| `closed`    | Position was sold |
| `blacklist` | Rejected or rugged coins |

These statuses are tracked in `coins.json` and updated by various components in the bot.
